    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I developed a Python script that automates the generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from textual content. Leveraging the power of natural language processing (NLP) with the spaCy library, the script processes input text to identify sentences and key terms such as nouns, proper nouns, adjectives, and numbers. These key terms are used to create fill-in-the-blank style questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each selected sentence, a key term is replaced with a blank, and a set of possible answers is generated. The correct answer is mixed with distractors, which are randomly selected from other key terms within the sentence. The script is designed to generate a customizable number of questions, making it a valuable tool for educators and content creators who need to quickly produce quiz questions from textual material."

    "The project’s flexibility is further demonstrated by its ability to handle different languages, such as Bengali, when the input is encoded in Unicode. This expands its potential applications beyond English, making it a valuable tool for global educational and content delivery platforms. Overall, the project represents a significant step towards integrating NLP techniques into practical, real-world applications, offering an innovative solution for generating educational content efficiently and effectively."
